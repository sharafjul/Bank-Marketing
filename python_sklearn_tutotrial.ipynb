This is because values in each of the categorical attribute was already encoded as numbers (1,2,3...etc.). This type of categorical encoding to numeric values is called Label encoding. It is valid to use this sort of method but it has a disadvantage that higher number could mean bigger weight for a value but it may just be a different value. We shall see another method to avoid this below. If we had strings in values, then the above code would have generated an error.

learnt how to implement classification algorithms in Python but we have just done basic exploratory data analysis in the beginning using info function, describe function,and  head function of Pandas. Here is a very good Python pacakge that performs varirty of the basic analysis by itself and generates a report for you. You can analyze mising values, dupicate values, correlation, etc.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"JBBcExPYgCU6"},"outputs":[],"source":["from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport\n","profile = ProfileReport(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":917,"referenced_widgets":["b534af22242f4f578acc5e8caf1025c6","5bcec5058c79452eac37a5d1c393117d","175a38f70a88471fab99039150ecd845","46e6e71327b44708af6c7fe2a7d79bf2","85e84ad1571a46e48c5c0f9e3071e8c0","dd5e18b28328457d9d603e0b68daf172","b19194373b124b279deb758778425924","f93017d8f2174030bdd1d1014e9ae6e0","53cfcbe36f3c4e60a614b455e0fdc8fc","93169215e19d46809e83c3b5a895cf4b","2b0a2606978a429fa97d2ecefa101381","a861a2e179bd437b8b799174f188d4bd","9295e1482f5c4230b1627c6cb495e4c5","715bde772ca742d58fcd1af6f5f9fff1","60047273bac946a3932c657dd1a611e7","22e55c81a7f34c84985ba357600c6092","c0a628b9f413485db71446d82a4ed0cf","b2ce614e64c746ca9dcf1be47ea8dcc6","eab8c524eac24099929797f93fd2eba0","39c3c99e2f5040028adfb37b4c700569","48f4aa34dbe445d98c663c538a593039","5893a86f08484b0295b8a365d48a0b3e","02ace6e350ef4546b51634cb1411b72c","e2e569bee6fb4655b19917ee6f1dabdd","1e5cfe4e67284b158a108a1e98f26971","aeb74b5368e3400982cc84e5b5e593c0","d759a3c76fcd4c61ad5251009c9457d8","ccec4ba3048b42178fb9033a4d3164a3","c8daa23708fc43c289f157e79e7b5456","98001687eb004c71baab77e3b6fda332","3edd487c4efd45fca2589f5a30c208e3","589af7c0d3504992982f89d20a4617a2","877180bb43774de1aad680cbe2e46e5f"],"output_embedded_package_id":"1EBV5BnFCHXJVzEUiPuXificRTetWwAtz"},"id":"8IB9rjEEh5Qh","outputId":"cdc6f9e7-8420-433c-b4fe-b2885c3d8b4c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1650036134005,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":24654,"user":{"displayName":"Iuliia Sharafutdinova","userId":"10496489647477363413"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}],"source":["profile.to_notebook_iframe()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q_tPMVvsBcot"},"source":["After you have performed exploratory analysis and determined the features or rows you would like to remove (if any) then you can use simple pandas statements to select a subset of data frame.
